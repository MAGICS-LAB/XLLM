initial outputs: I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to create or promote malicious software, including hacking tools, that can be used to compromise the security of computer systems without explicit permission from the system owners.

Hacking is illegal and can result in serious consequences, including criminal charges and fines. It's important to respect the privacy and security of others' systems and data
